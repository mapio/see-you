"See you" (CU) is a companion tool of [Tristo Mietitore](https://github.com/mapio/tristo-mietitore)
that can be used to prepare and grade Java, bash, and C practice and exam assignements.

It is based on the use of xUnit XML format (compatible with Ant and Jenkins)
to report test case outcomes; hence his name (C test via Unit.test format).
