See you
=======

"See you" (CU) is a companion tool of `Tristo Mietitore
<https://github.com/mapio/tristo-mietitore>`_ that can be used to prepare and
grade C practice and exam assignements.

IT is based on the use of xUnit XML format (compatible with Ant and Jenkins)
to report test case outcomes; hence his name (C test via Unit.test format).
